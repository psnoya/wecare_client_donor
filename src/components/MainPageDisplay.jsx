            Every year more than 100 000 tons of food is wasted in stores all
            over Sweden. At the same time there are parants who don’t have the
            economical means to feed their children. We at weCare aim to create
            a bridge between stores and single moms in order to reduce food
            waste and eliminate children not getting enough food.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>We at weCare have created a platform where a store can
            register and become a food donor. With our easy to navigate UX a
            store can register food bags and decide when the food bag can be
            picked up. For the moms on the other hand we created a mobile app
            for both Apple and Android users where the user can find stores that
            have available food bags and make a reservation and then go to the
            store and pick it up.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>By registering at weCare you as a store can help not only
            families all over Sweden but also make a huge impact on the
            environment. By reducing food waste we can together stop the rapid
            climate change that is happening right now.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>So sign up today, to make a better tomorrow!
